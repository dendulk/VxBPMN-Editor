the xpdl package is generated. This is done by JAXB. Using a JAXB compiler you can 
give a XSD schema as input from which it generates Java Source code. This has the 
advantage that you don't need to complex DOM or SAX processing anymore. You can 
directly use the generated classes. 


you can run the JAXB compiler as follows. open a console where yout jaxb compiler 
resides then type: xjc [filename]

For XPDL2.1 a modified XSD file was used. this because the normal version doesn't 
compile and gives a lot of errors. The modified XSD file is modified again to 
support PVDI Constraints.
